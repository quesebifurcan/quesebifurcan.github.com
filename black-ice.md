four musical reflections on a film by Stan Brakhage
---

The film "Black Ice" was made in 1994 by Stan Brakhage, one of the most important experimental filmmakers of the last century. 

It unfolds its images at a high speed, making it very difficult for the viewer to extract one single, clearly delineated impression of it. In the (impossible) task of translating its vivid imagery to music, I tried to tune in to the above-mentioned perceptual ambiguity by creating 4 different kinds of music, each of them moving at a different pace, each one "highlighting" different aspects of the same film. 

"Black Ice" is a sister piece to the piano work "The Fold". It was composed at roughly the same time, using a very similar Open Music-patch for the generation of the rhythmical structures onto which the sounds are mapped.
